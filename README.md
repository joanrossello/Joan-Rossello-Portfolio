Data science & machine learning portfolio comprising projects from 2021/2022.

# [Project 1: Show, Attend and Tell with Transformers](https://github.com/joanrossello/Image-Captioning)
Image captioning is a now well-established challenge in the Computer Vision/Natural Language Processing community, which consists in generating an accurate description, or caption, of a given input image. This is typically done using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to extract features from the image followed by a language model to sequentially predict an output sentence from these features. This work aims to investigate if by simply using the current state-of-the-art **transformer** architectures for feature extraction and sequence processing, we can train an accurate image captioning network with a limited amount of resources. We also investigate if incorporating the word embeddings and bounding boxes of objects detected in the image in a **multi-task learning** approach, can further improve the modelâ€™s accuracy. The models are evaluated on the Flickr8k and Flickr30k datasets using the BLEU metric with beam search.

The images show example Predictions (P) with 5 potential targets (T1-T5) on the test set with highest BLEU score.
